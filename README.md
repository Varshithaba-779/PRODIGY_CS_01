Encryption and Decryption:
Encryption: For each letter in the input text, the program shifts the letter by the specified shift value to the right.
Decryption: The program shifts the letter by the specified shift value to the left by using a negative shift.

Character Handling:
The program checks whether a character is uppercase or lowercase to handle the shift correctly within the respective alphabet range.
Non-alphabetical characters (like spaces, numbers, punctuation) are left unchanged.

User Interaction:
The program asks the user whether they want to encrypt or decrypt a message.
The user inputs the message and the shift value, and the program outputs the encrypted or decryptedÂ result.
